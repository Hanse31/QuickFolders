Release 4.21

This release backports some of the fixes that were also done in the new version for Thunderbird 78. If you want to get the latest features, I highly recommend updating Thunderbird to the current 78 release version.

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/117">[issue 117]</a> Added color picker for text color in tab-specific properties.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/132">[issue 132]</a> In a single message tab, quickMove used to redisplay the mail after moving it with quickMove.
This behavior has now been changed on request to go to the next unread email instead. It can be modified by editing the following configuration settings (the <a href="#5.5">Thunderbird 78 version</a> of QuickFolders has a dedicated User Interface):

<tt>extensions.quickfolders.quickMove.reopenMsgTabAfterMove</tt>
<tt>extensions.quickfolders.quickMove.gotoNextUnreadAfterMove</tt></li>
<li>QuickFolders Settings, now makes sure that correct options tab is opened / remembered</li>
</ul>


<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/115">[issue 115]</a> Fixed restoring of config values. Some general / layout settings were not restored properly even when they were saved during backup.</li>
</ul>
