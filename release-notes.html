Release 4.21.3

This release backports some of the fixes that were also done in the new version for Thunderbird 78. If you want to get the latest features, I highly recommend updating Thunderbird to the current 78 release version.

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li> 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/144">[issue 144]</a> Mark folders + subfolders read stops at first generation (direct child folder) mails  
</li>
<li> 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/144">[issue 144]</a> Thunderbird 60 users only - QuickFolders always offers update to 4.21.2 - this is due to a faulty version number in the deprecated file install.rdf (which isn't used by Thunderbird 66 - 91 anymore).

I am working on making QuickFolders compatible with Thunderbird 91, which is planned for release in summer 2021. There is a lot of rewriting going on in the background in order to replace internal functionality with the new API model. If you still ust THunderbird 68 or older, consider at least switching to Thunderbird 78 to get the <a href="https://quickfolders.org/version.html#latest">latest version of QuickFolders</a>.
