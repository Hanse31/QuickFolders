Release 4.19.1

This release backports some of the fixes that were also done in the new version for Thunderbird 78. If you want to get the latest features, I highly recommend updating Thunderbird to the current 78 release version.

<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/75">[issue 75]</a> support moving folders via the quickMove button</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/72">[issue 72]</a> Category "_Uncategorized" will show all categories after moving a folder to another category</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/23">[issue 23]</a> Fixed: quickMove aborts with "Nothing to do: Message is already in folder" if the first mail in the selection is already in target folder. This may happen if you drag mails from a multi-folder view such as a search results window. It can also happen if you execute the quickMove command after a while and you (or a filter) have moved some of the mails to the target folder already.</li>
<li>Improved reopening any support sites already open in a tab by jumping to the correct place if necessary.</li>
<li>Fixed: when restarting Thunderbird after an Add-on was installed Tabs from ALL categories were displayed.</li>
