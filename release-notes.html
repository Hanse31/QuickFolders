<b>Maintenance Version 5.10.3 - 14/07/2022</b>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/281">[issue 281]</a> this maintenance version will be able to reconstruct tabs after upgrading from Thunderbird 91 to 102 even if the server and username have been modified due to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573690">bug 1573690</a>. The previous version failed with reconstructing these on IMAP folders.
To automatically rebuild (and avoiding invalid tabs) is only possible if <b>5.10.1 was previously run on an older profile (Thunderbird 91 or older)</b>

If you already upgraded to Thunderbird 102 previously and experience invalid tabs, you can now generate troubleshooting information via right-click <i>QuickFolders Commands / Tab Specific Properties...</i> This will copy the assumed account and the (invalid) folder URI to the clipboard.

For reference you can click on any real folder in the folder tree and then SHIFT+Click on the QuickFolders tool icon, then select <i>Debug / Copy current folder info!</i> This will copy the account and correct expected URI to the clipboard. By comparison of these data points it I can fix your folders through exporting the folder configuration and then text search+replace the differing URIs (or by simply inserting the correct account)

<b>Known Issues</b>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/283">[issue 283]</a> Thunderbird 102 is severely slowing down compared to Thunderbrid 91 with QuickFolders installed. I am currently working on a permanent solution - if you would like to test preview versions you can download them at the github issue linked above.</li>
