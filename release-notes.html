<b>Thunderbird 68 specific Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li> Fixed: number fields are displayed too wide and with unnecessary paddings which may lead to legibility issues after preferences.css had to he removed.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/8">[issue 8]</a> in Thunderbird 70, the label is removed on right-clicking a tab. Also, the quickJump and quickMove functions stopped working.

I highly recommend using the current release version Thunderbird 68.* and not a beta version on your daily mail profile as there will be many breaking changes in the next months. If you want to use beta versions, make sure to use a test profile and regularly back up your mail to avoid data loss.</li>
<li> The filter template dialog isn't shown properly in Thunderbird 68 - generally I would recommend to install the <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/quickfilters/">quickFilters Add-on</a> instead, as it has more advanced functions for managing and creating mail filters.  </li>
</ul>
