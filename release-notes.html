Release 4.21.4

This release backports some of the fixes that were also done in the new version for Thunderbird 78. If you want to get the latest features, I highly recommend updating Thunderbird to the current 78 release version.

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/148">[issue 148]</a> quickMove: parent folder containing an underscore not suggested as parent if typed from fully. This is a regression caused by changes in             <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/135">[issue 135]</a> which allows for entering parent names by entering text within the string if that starts with an underscore or space - e.g. to find all child folders of "001_Test" you could just type "tes/". The regression caused it not to be suggested when typing "001_tes/" as it only would evaluate the substrings "001" and "Test" as possible parents.

I am working on making QuickFolders compatible with Thunderbird 91, which is planned for release in summer 2021. There is a lot of rewriting going on in the background in order to replace internal functionality with the new API model. If you still ust THunderbird 68 or older, consider at least switching to Thunderbird 78 to get the <a href="https://quickfolders.org/version.html#latest">latest version of QuickFolders</a>.
