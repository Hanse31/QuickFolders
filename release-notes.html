<li> <a name="26654" href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26658" target="_blank">[Bug 26658]</a> ESR 2019 Readiness - compatibility with Thunderbird 68.

Made QuickFolders compatible with Thunderbird 68 - part of the ongoing effort to future proof QuickFolders for 2020.  For now, this also means making the minimum requirement using Thunderbird version 60.</li>
<li> Added lightweight theme support for current folder bar. 

For best result, select the "lighweight" option on the background dropdown on the <i>Advanced</i> tab. I also slimmed down the layout for retrieving some added vertical space. You can further tweak ergonomics of the central navigation panel by decreasing the "Left Spacer" value.</li>

Setting From Identity or To To Address was always applied to all subfolders even if the option "[x] Also apply to subfolders" was not selected. From now on, this option will work. </li>
<li> Support 'Cursor Up' key to jump to bottom of search results in quickJump / quickMove function.</li>
<li> <a name="26665" href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26665" target="_blank">[Bug 26665]</a> Cancel quickmove and erase list of messages with SHIFT+Escape.</li>
