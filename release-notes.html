Release 4.20

This release backports some of the fixes that were also done in the new version for Thunderbird 78. If you want to get the latest features, I highly recommend updating Thunderbird to the current 78 release version.

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/82">[issue 82]</a> Improved sorting of search results during quickMove / quickJump.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/109">[issue 109]</a> Menu item Mark Messages read in Folder + subfolders not displayed as expected - it was only shown if the folder of the tab didn't have unread emails itself. This additional menu item that can be used to set subfolders read was only displayed if the actual folder of the tab itself had no unread emails, and only child folders had them. Configure this command in QuickFolders settings / Advanced / Menu Configuration / Mail Commands</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/37">[issue 37]</a> When no match is found using the "/" in quickMove box, display "No matching parent folders!" instead of "..."</li></ul>
