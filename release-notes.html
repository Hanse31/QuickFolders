Release 4.22

This release backports some of the fixes that were also done in the new version for Thunderbird 78. If you want to get the latest features, I highly recommend updating Thunderbird to the current 78 release version.
To support QuickFolders, <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=atn-version-page">buy a license</a> or <a href="https://quickfolders.org/donate.html?referrer=atn-version-page">donate</a> to support the project.

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/155">[issue 155]</a> Support entering multiple words in a search string to find longer folder names that are composited, such as "Fred.Flintstone" "Invoices June 2020" "Research+Development". These can now be found by entering the starting letters of the words within the folder name, in any order. e.g. "f f" "2020 inv" "Dev Res". The following characters are regarded as word boundaries and don't need to be typed:
_ . - + & @

This can also be combined with the existing parent folder syntax by entering the parent folder start followed by a forward slash "/", e.g. enter "A/rev a" to match subfolders like "AMO » AMO-Reviews" "Addons » Accepted Revisions".

Use the new character ">" to skip any folder within the path.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/163">[issue 163]</a> quickMove: folder created while moving is not displayed on top of recent folders menu.</li>

I am working on making QuickFolders compatible with Thunderbird 91, which is planned for release in summer 2021. There is a lot of rewriting going on in the background in order to replace internal functionality with the new API model. If you still ust THunderbird 68 or older, consider at least switching to Thunderbird 78 to get the <a href="https://quickfolders.org/version.html#latest">latest version of QuickFolders</a>.
</li>
<li>The maximum number of search results in quickMove can now be larger than 25 by editing the following configuration setting: extensions.quickfolders.quickMove.maxResults </li>
</ul>
