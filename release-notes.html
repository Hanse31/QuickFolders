Release 4.18.2

This release backports some of the fixes that were also done in the new version for Thunderbird 78. If you want to get the latest features, it is recommended to update Thunderbird to the current 78 release version.

<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/80">[issue 80]</a> Recent Folders list not updated when moving email using drag and drop to the folder tree.  I have made the updating of this folder time stamp somewhat more aggressive, but avoiding to add folders like Inbox, Sent, Archives, Drafts, Junk, Trash and Templates because they would always end up on top.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/35">[issue 35]</a> "Skip Unread Folder" hides "Add star" function... 

the Shortcut for skipping unread folders works even without pressing the Shift key</li>
<li> Reading list: jumping to a missing mail brings up a search dialog. The conditions were not automatically filled - this version fixes that 
in Thunderbird 68.12.  I am not sure from which version forward this stopped working.</li>
<li> In the dialog "change order of tabs" the up and down labels on the buttons are not rendered for some reason - this is now worked around by removing the button styling from these elements</li>
<li> improve dropmarker behavior when dragging tabs over multiple rows </li>
<li> Thunderbird 78: QuickFolders is now also compatible with the new Thunderbird ESR</li>
</ul>
