<b>Version 4.15.3</b>
<ul>
<li> <a name="26671" href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26671" target="_blank">[Bug 26671]</a> Only one row of tabs after update to QuickFolders 4.15.1 - this can also lead  to trailing tabs missing on screen.

I had uploaded a fix in 4.15.2 but something rolleed back the code, so it's now officially fixed with version 4.15.3.

The new backup / restore tool will also display tabs which have no valid folders. If you have problems with outdated tabs being shown, you may additionally want to  execute the <i>find orphaned tabs</i> command.</li>
