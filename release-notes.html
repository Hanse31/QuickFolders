<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/283">[issue 283]</a> Slowdown of Thunderbird 102 with QuickFolders

There is some inefficiency in the Thunderbird code base for the folder tree which can be exascerbated by QuickFolders. I have removed as many function calls as I could find without impacting on functionality. On startup some right-click menus have to be generated to make drag+drop, these are now generated at a later stage to yield some time to the User Interface.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/279">[issue 279]</a> Fixed: Thunderbird 102 - current category is not remembered / selected; in this solution I store the current category of each tab (folder and messages) whenever a tab is opened / moved or closed. Information is only stored for one single window, so it might get confused if you open multiple windows with different categories per tab. It works reasonably for most general uses of QuickFolder categories.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/280">[issue 280]</a> Folder tree icons did not work independently of tabs in Thunderbird 102.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/284">[issue 284]</a> Recent folders menu doesn't show or takes a very long time in Thunderbird 102 - There is some inefficent code in Thunderbird 102 at the moment, so I have started to use their own internal function to generate this. </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/287">[issue 287]</a> Fixed the deleting of invalid (orphaned) tabs through the tool menu command "remove invalid tabs". </li>
</ul>
