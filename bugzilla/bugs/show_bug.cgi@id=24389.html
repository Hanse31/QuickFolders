QuickFolders 2.8 (at the moment).

At almost every startup, QuickFolders loads a web page with its version history
_and_ pops up an alert box telling me that it was successfully updated to some
version or other.

In an attempt to override this annoying behaviour and look for updates when it
suits _me_ (about daily, just before installing the next SeaMonkey nightly), I
have clicked &quot;Reset all add-ons to update manually&quot; in the add-ons manager, and
even &quot;Check for updates: Never&quot; in the details view for QuickFolders, to no
avail: the web page and alert box still appeared at the latest startup.

Imagine what woulod happen if everyone did as you do:

Once upon a time, the addons manager would open a popup at startup with one
line for every addon which had received an update. That was bearable because it
was one popup for all. But I have several tens of addons installed, and of
those, about twenty are on nightly schedule and receive an update (installed by
me) every single day. If they did this, it would mean, at every install of a
new SeaMonkey nightly, about twenty popups springing up at startup and about
twenty tabs which I hadn't asked for, in addition to those in my webpage. No
thanks.

Well, it didn't, updating itself from 2.8hc-AddonManagerVersionPending to 2.8
without my say-so, despite the fact that auto-update was set to &quot;Never&quot; both as
my default and as an explicit setting for this addon; and yet the &quot;Recent
updates&quot; page of the add-ons manager doesn't mention QuickFolders.

Since I changed this bug to point to a different issue in the meantime, I'm
going to open a different bug on the principle &quot;one issue, one bug&quot;.

Must be a bug. This only happens if the version number changes (see bug 

<span class="quote">&gt;

Just to get it straight: This is the case for updating the _addons_.

I know there are numerous addons (which are based on donations) that bring up
web pages (but no popup) when _they_ are updated, e.g. firebug, flashget,
noscript, imageZoom, quick translator to name but a few. 

Would you be happier if I removed the popup message but kept the update
message? I think it is important to communicate change  logs to the user when
something in her system changes.

The other thing is the donation page, you can already disable this by following
the instructions in it. Basically go to QF Options and right click the text
above the donation link (&quot;If you love...&quot;). However version history IMHO should
be mandatory. The extension updates roughly once a month and this is caused by
important bug fixes and new features.

<span class="quote">&gt; But I have several tens of addons installed, and of

Can you explain about this, does this mean that their version number changes on
a nightly basis? This won't happen with QuickFolders, it might change once a
month, because I simply do not have time to update it every day - in that case
I would obviously refrain from any messages. But remember the message is
supposed to show only when the version number changes.

<span class="quote">&gt; If they did this, it would mean, at every install of a

The version of the host application changing does normally _not_ cause a
reinstall/update of the extension (only in the case if max Version is not
reached or if a new version of the _extension_ is released). If you are
experiencing this, it is definitely a bug and not a feature of QuickFolders.

can you try to set the version to 2.8 manually? I did a test with SeaMonkey and
it updated itself to 2.8 after I had set the version to
2.8hc-AddonManagerVersionPending. maybe that's a step it tries to do on your
system but fails every ime for some reason, hence the repeated message.

If I understand you correctly you did not observe the same behavior with
previous versions of QF?

see <a href="show_bug.cgi@id=24389.html#c4">comment #4</a>: it did that itself at the next startup (when I installed the

I'm not sure. Recently I installed a dedvelopment version from your site.
Previously I used AMO versions which still displayed the version history and
the popup saying &quot;QuickFolders has been successfully updated to version X&quot; but
much less often. I have nothing against the fact that development versions are
updated often, even daily; but please don't load a browser tab and pop an alert
every time a successful update happens, or at least have an option somewhere to
disable them.

Yes, or else keep them by default, but with a setting somewhere — even, let's
say, a new setting, &quot;extensions.quickfolders.silentUpgrade — default —
boolean — false&quot; with no other UI than about:config.

<span class="quote">&gt;

When you wrote this, it didn't ring a bell with me; but I see that
extensions.quickfolders.donateNoMore is already true in about:config — I must
have done that at some time in the past.

<span class="quote">&gt; However version history IMHO should
&gt; be mandatory. The extension updates roughly once a month and this is caused by

I see there is a link on the last (&quot;Support&quot;) tab of the QF options. Maybe in
addition a prominent link on the addon-manager detail view would be a nice
touch: that update history page is indeed interesting, and I'd want to check it
from time to time even if there is no update, but not at startup when I have my
mind bent on other things.

BTW (I just called it up) I notice that it hasn't yet been updated to mention
anything more recent than &quot;a prerelease of 2.7.3&quot; near the top of the page
(version 2.8 is mentioned lower down, but the &quot;full version details&quot; link from
the top of the page bypasses it and goes to 2.7.2).

Also, let's say that these &quot;new features&quot; are maybe less of a scoop for me
because I follow all QF bugs at bugzilla.mozdev.org (by watching you). Of
course I wouldn't expect the average QF user to do the same.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But I have several tens of addons installed, and of

Well, no, the version doesn't change every day, and I don't see the popup and
tab when the QF version hasn't changed. Maybe I was exaggerating ;-) (just a
tiny wee bit) ;-) in an attempt to drive my point home by rhetoric. The 20
add-on nightlies I install every day (Lightning, the Provider for Google
Calendar, and the SeaMonkey language packs) are compiled by the Mozilla
buildbots, which unlike you (and me) don't need to sleep, eat, shop, wash,
cook, or do any of these mundane things which we humans have to.

&gt; &gt; system but fails every ime for some reason, hence the repeated message.
&gt; 
&gt; see <a href="show_bug.cgi@id=24389.html#c4">comment #4</a>: it did that itself at the next startup (when I installed the
&gt; next SeaMonkey nightly).</span >

ok, I have scrutinized the code a bit more, and whenever you see the &quot;hc&quot; this
means the version check routine of Mozilla has fucked up.

I put in the &quot;hc&quot; for &quot;hard coded&quot; and its the last resort fallback when the
AddonManager never gives back the version number of my extension. Mozilla have
decided to run version number requests asynchronously and this fuck up is a
direct effect from it. We cannot just check the version number any more we have
to pass in an asyncronous callback function, and god know when that is called -
if ever. I am currently working on a fix that does the &quot;unimportant&quot; checking
whether the extension is  ran for the first time and all the &quot;unimportant&quot;
house keeping (like tidying up old config settings, selecting a proper layout
etc) _after_ thunderbird has decided to pass back the version number. 

At the moment it is broken but I am hoping to have a patched version for you by
tonight.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I understand you correctly you did not observe the same behavior with
&gt; &gt; previous versions of QF?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure. Recently I installed a development version from your site.
&gt; Previously I used AMO versions which still displayed the version history and
&gt; the popup saying &quot;QuickFolders has been successfully updated to version X&quot; but
&gt; much less often. I have nothing against the fact that development versions are
&gt; updated often, even daily; </span >

I think you always have to install development (prereleases) manually, so the
extra click shouldn't hurt there. But I will remove the popup message from the
automatic installation process; in fact I have already coded it yesterday,
since I expect more users to complain about it :)


<span class="quote">&gt; but please don't load a browser tab and pop an alert
&gt; every time a successful update happens, or at least have an option somewhere to
&gt; disable them.</span >

Yes that can be done. The way to go there could also be triggered (sneakily) by
right-clicking the version number on the options dialog. btw, The main reason
to do it this way is not to be sneaky, but not to clutter up the interface with
millions of options that do not bring any value to the average user.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; Yes, or else keep them by default, but with a setting somewhere — even, let's
&gt; say, a new setting, &quot;extensions.quickfolders.silentUpgrade — default —
&gt; boolean — false&quot; with no other UI than about:config.
&gt; </span >

yes, along these lines, no problem. But bear with me until the bug itself (QF
not being able to read its proper version number) is fixed first. Then lets
implement the workaround.

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The other thing is the donation page, you can already disable this by following
&gt; &gt; the instructions in it. Basically go to QF Options and right click the text
&gt; &gt; above the donation link (&quot;If you love...&quot;).
&gt; 
&gt; When you wrote this, it didn't ring a bell with me; but I see that
&gt; extensions.quickfolders.donateNoMore is already true in about:config — I must
&gt; have done that at some time in the past.</span >

Yep, that one is handy. I guess version history should be the same. [bye bye
donations ;) ] People only donate on or shortly after extension updates. They
only started to donate after I put in the web page that comes up when they
update... :)

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; &gt; However version history IMHO should
&gt; &gt; be mandatory. The extension updates roughly once a month and this is caused by
&gt; &gt; important bug fixes and new features.
&gt; 
&gt; I see there is a link on the last (&quot;Support&quot;) tab of the QF options. </span >

and like you, most users don't even know that it is there. Hence the force-feed
:p

I simply want to avoid hundreds of users submitting bug reports about new
features like the Current Folder Bar, so I think its only fair not to surprise
them.

<span class="quote">&gt; Maybe in
&gt; addition a prominent link on the addon-manager detail view would be a nice
&gt; touch: that update history page is indeed interesting, and I'd want to check it
&gt; from time to time even if there is no update, but not at startup when I have my
&gt; mind bent on other things.</span >

Good idea - If I can find a way to add it, I will.


<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; BTW (I just called it up) I notice that it hasn't yet been updated to mention
&gt; anything more recent than &quot;a prerelease of 2.7.3&quot; near the top of the page
&gt; (version 2.8 is mentioned lower down, but the &quot;full version details&quot; link from
&gt; the top of the page bypasses it and goes to 2.7.2).</span >

The jump down to the current version is automatic after an automatic update.
Then it _should_ jump to version.html#2.8. Of course the same should happen
when you follow the link from the QF options page (but it doesn't so time for
fixing that as well).



<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; Also, let's say that these &quot;new features&quot; are maybe less of a scoop for me
&gt; because I follow all QF bugs at bugzilla.mozdev.org (by watching you). Of
&gt; course I wouldn't expect the average QF user to do the same.</span >

true =)

Versiom 2.8.3 preRelease 8

Here is a version for you.
1. Fixes annoying behavior - update message is not modal anymore and onlyt
appears once (on actual version change, not falsely). I have stabilized the
methods for retrieving the version number.

OK, I assume this attachment obsoletes the one from <a href="show_bug.cgi@id=24389.html#c10">comment #10</a>.

I'm about to close down the following build in order to install the next
nightly; I'll install this extension at the same time (with a compatibility
override of course).

&quot;AddonManager.getAddonByID() is unreliable&quot;, what you're saying here sounds
like it could be related to what Dave Garrett experienced with his Flagfox
extension. In both cases, IIUC, &quot;you never can tell&quot; when the add-ons manager
has had time enough to do its stuff.

QuickFolders 2.8.3pre8 from <span class="bz_obsolete"><a href="QF-2.8.3pre8.xpi.1" name="attach_7072" title="Version 2.8.3 preRelease 8">attachment #7072</a> <a href="https://quickfolders.org/bugzilla/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=7072&amp;action=edit" title="Version 2.8.3 preRelease 8">[details]</a></span>

extension compatibility override is in effect
(extensions.checkCompatibility.2.6a and extensions.checkCompatibility.nightly
are set to false)

Ah, unexpected but nice! Instead of the bang-in-the-face XUL-like popup in the
center of the screen, I got a &quot;system notification&quot; next to the clock at bottom
right, in the same style as what any Gnome or KDE utility might give, telling
me about the version update. Much less obnoxious. And the version history tab
did not open.

AFAICT, I still have the same QF tabs in the mailer, and they work, but I
suppose that that part of the code hasn't changed — you'd have had to commit
a spectacular f**kup before they stopped functioning _this_ time.

Ah, and at mouseover the &quot;2.8.3pre8&quot; says &quot;Right-click for version history&quot; in
a tooltip.

The addons manager details view includes a [Contribute] button (all hope isn't
lost yet for your bank account) and a link to
<a href="http://quickfolders.mozdev.org/index.html">http://quickfolders.mozdev.org/index.html</a> which is an outdated home page, where
the &quot;What's New&quot; sidebar only lists versions 2.5 and later. Maybe that's where
you could point to the (almost) up-to-date version history at
<a href="http://quickfolders.mozdev.org/version.html">http://quickfolders.mozdev.org/version.html</a> ... which I cannot get to display
from the options dialog, neither by clicking the link on the Support tab nor by
right-clicking the version number (that gives me a dialog, &quot;Display version
history? [Cancel] [OK]&quot; but when I click OK, nothing happens other than
dismissing the dialog). I can get at the history by the &quot;Version History&quot;
tab-like link near the top of the &quot;homepage&quot; linked from the addons manager
detail view; and the version and link in the top paragraph are updated.

Ah, and while I'm at it: about:addons (&quot;Extensions&quot; list view, &quot;Recent Updates&quot;
list view, and detail view), about:support[<a href="mailto:quickfolders@curious.be">quickfolders@curious.be</a>], and
about:config[extensions.quickfolders.version] all agree that this is version
2.8.3pre8 of QuickFolders.

Axel, you've made me happy. If this were Mozilla, I'd flag this attachment with
feedback+ (with the above-mentioned reservations).

Hey thanks, we're talking SeaMonkey here? Will be on it shortly :-)

Drag and Drop is a bit of a hell to program, what works in Thunderbird might
fail in SeaMonkey and do a completely different thing in Postbox. Anyway these
error messages (and reproducing the bug on SeaMonkey) should help.

Ok, that IS a regression caused by me adding the &quot;use strict&quot; option in order
to find any loose global variables. I will fix this now and upload a newer test
version.

addFolder is the function that adds the dragged folder to the QF toolbar.

&gt; &gt; Ah, problem (and regression): creating a new folder-tab by drag-dropping from
&gt; &gt; the tree pane doesn't work. Tried it with a &quot;News &amp; Blogs&quot; (RSS feed) folder,
&gt; &gt; several folders of the &quot;Local Folders&quot; (pseudo-)server, and an NNTP newsgroup.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ohoh! And in addition, the &quot;version&quot; on the QuickFolders &quot;Help&quot; dialog (whose
&gt; titlebar says &quot;QuickFolder Options&quot;) says 2.8.2hc-AddonManagerVersionPending
&gt; (but hte Options dialog itself still has 2.8.3pre8 )
&gt; </span >

Cool, you will be my official beta tester!

The way I open the options dialog here is different, and I simply forgot to
pass in the &quot;known&quot; version number.

It works like this: on QF startup I am starting a timer routine that asks Addon
Manager to pass back the version number of my extension. Once it comes back (so
the latest change) I am running my firstRun test which will check if an update
or a new install have been carried out. During that  I compare the (hopefully
correct) current version number with the one recorded in
extensions.quickfolders.version (that should never be a hc one! - hc stands for
hard coded and it means the version algorithm has f..ed up).

1) If there is _no_ version recorded, then it is a new install, and it should
open the QF homepage.
2) If the version is the same, no action is taken
3) If the version is different, I assume an update - then overwrite the version
number with the current one (e.g. 2.8.3pre12) and display version info and
donation page. (which you can block with these right clicks)

3a) If the version is &gt;=2.7 and previous wasn't then some about:config settings
are tidied up according to extension standards (all configuration settings
should start with extensions.quickfolders); also the new theming engine is
configured for the first time and the &quot;Pimp my tabs&quot;dialog is shown.

So there is a helluva amount of work in that startup routine, and I am quite
cheesed off at Mozilla that they decided to &quot;!bork!&quot; it by removing the simple
way of retrieving the version number. Of course a workaround is to hardcode the
known version number and increase it manually on every build, but I think that
is just bad style.

Anyway, I will upload a fix for these ones as well.

Ok this one is a bit better; tested in SeaMonkey 2.2 and addresses the
regressions you mnentioned above. Please note that the update message comes
only up (ther very first time) when the mail window is used. The Addon Manager

Other settings as before.

D&amp;D works again. (Rename-tab still works.) New tab is always dropped at the far
right but can then be moved by dragging it along.

Help, Support and Options all say 2.8.3pre16 which agrees with about:addons,
about:support and about:config.

Didn't notice any notification. I see the version history tab after my other
browser tabs but maybe I triggered it inattentively by checking the support
dialog.

In the error console, one error is repeated very many times:
Error: this.preferences.rootBranchInternal is undefined

Line: 122

Other errors and warnings are as follows:

Obviously, they don't all concern you (at least, this last one doesn't ;-) )

The rest looks OK after checking what I had noticed in the above comments. B-)

Just a note on this:

behavior by design.

In fact when you re-order the tabs you have to drag them _on top of_ another
tab (not in between) to move them as the Toolbar (background) itself is
&quot;position-agnostic&quot;. Only the tabs listen for drop events from other tabs.

So I am not doing any fancy calculation from the perspective of the toolbar in
order to see where the re-positioned tab is being dropped. (if you try to
reposition by dropping exactly in between 2 tabs exactly you will also end up
at the far right, even in &quot;re-positioning mode&quot;). If this ever gets flagged as
a bug I will reject it as WONTFIX.

Likewise, you cannot drop a new folder on top of an existing tab, it is simply
ignored. New folders can only be dragged to the far left or the far right of
the toolbar area (in between two being the same as far right); that's as fancy
as it will get with dragging folders. So drops of FOLDERS on the toolbar itself
are also &quot;postion-agnostic&quot; - to a point.

It still is a huge improvement on the legacy re-positioning system though,
which you can see by selecting &quot;change the order of the bookmarks&quot;. A fugly
implementation from the original extension. (I added the animation on the top).

&gt; </span >

That's an interesting way to use home tabs. Until recently I was using tab
groups and the session restore feature and (I didn't count them) that would
load up my 50-80 tabs. But it didn't seem to be reliable as it just came up
blank one day - guess that's the reason why you using home tabs, right?

I feel an idea for an extension coming up &quot;Session Excavator&quot; something that
restores the tabs + groups from last week would be a real fine thing. But we
digress, lets concentrate on this bug. Tell me if you find any other
regressions in &quot;Another Patch&quot; QF 2.8.3pre16. I think dragging works again and
also the version history jump. What's more the correct version number should
now display in all variations of the options window (QuickFolders Support /
QuickFolders Help / QuickFolders Options) as I am now always passing in the
instance. With one notable exception, and that is (of all things) clicking the
options button from the Addon Manager, that needs to be fixed as well before i
release QF 2.9. Unfortunately being called from AM again I have a lot less
control, and I need to find some special hack in order to get at the version
number of the main window. possibly another settimer. The main thing is that AM
decides when it calls the callback function that can then do something with the
version number. And I had tried to set that up in the load event of the options
window, but it seemed like it never triggered so I chose the easier workaround
to pass it in from the main window, which typically would have the version
number loaded long ago. Well another challenge ahead.

&gt; &gt; P.S. The only warning which looks like it might be relevant (but maybe it
&gt; &gt; isn't) is the one about transferData.first being null at
&gt; &gt; chrome://global/content/nsDragAndDrop.js line 470.</span >

<span class="quote">&gt; Thanks, does that one happen every time a message is dropped? Could be a
&gt; SeaMonkey specific bug, definitely not a QuickFolders one. I might try to
&gt; reproduce it when I am very very bored :-)
&gt; </span >

AFAICT it does: I just drag-dropped two folders (one after another) to the QF
toolbar and the error appeared twice at the top of my error console. But as I
said, the drop does happen despite of them.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's OK. At the moment, my startup procedure consists of having SeaMonkey
&gt; &gt; open MailNews, ChatZilla, and a dummy Browser window with only a blank tab;
&gt; &gt; then I click Home in the browser to load my (how many?… 169 at the moment)
&gt; &gt; home tabs when the rest has stabilized.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That's an interesting way to use home tabs. Until recently I was using tab
&gt; groups and the session restore feature and (I didn't count them) that would
&gt; load up my 50-80 tabs. But it didn't seem to be reliable as it just came up
&gt; blank one day - guess that's the reason why you using home tabs, right?</span >
[...]
Yes, somehow I don't trust the session restore feature. Before it even existed
I took the habit of setting my home page to &quot;Use Current Group&quot; at closedown
and reloading my home tabs at startup (the Tab Mix Plus extension for Firefox
used to have session-restore features but it never worked on SeaMonkey); then
there was the problem that a startup-crashing session would be restored (and
crash again) at next restart… I seem to have found a way to avoid startup
race conditions due to bandwith limitations between the browser (restoring
hundreds of tabs) and the mailer (polling all servers for new messages). One
caveat is that if a tab comes up empty (only the grey background) it must be
loaded manually (e.g. with the Go button) or it will be saved as &quot;about:blank&quot;
(OTOH a XUL error page with a retry button on it will be saved OK). These empty
tabs are listed as &quot;Untitled&quot; in the tabs menu (from the Tabs Menu extension or
presumably the all-tabs menu on the tab bar, for which I have a display:none
userChrome rule to reclaim valuable real estate) and they have the default
favicon; the XUL error pages have some error title and a /!\ favicon.

Tab groups is a feature recently added to Firefox, but AFAIK not ported to
SeaMonkey (yet).
[...]
<span class="quote">&gt; With one notable exception, and that is (of all things) clicking the
&gt; options button from the Addon Manager, that needs to be fixed as well before i
&gt; release QF 2.9. Unfortunately being called from AM again I have a lot less
&gt; control, and I need to find some special hack in order to get at the version
&gt; number of the main window. possibly another settimer. The main thing is that AM
&gt; decides when it calls the callback function that can then do something with the
&gt; version number. And I had tried to set that up in the load event of the options
&gt; window, but it seemed like it never triggered so I chose the easier workaround
&gt; to pass it in from the main window, which typically would have the version
&gt; number loaded long ago. Well another challenge ahead.
&gt; </span >

You won't be the first to have problems with that [Preferences] button in the
addons manager: the ChatZilla preferences look much better (and are resizable)
when called from the ChatZilla window or even from the SeaMonkey preferences
dialog. I've seen a bug recently about that but forgot the number.

It will go away if you install the non-obsolete attachment to this bug, which
is an .xpi for QuickFolders 2.8.3pre16. Download it to your HD, then install
from there.

Done. 

On restart two update notification tabs appeared, which was weird. But then I
restarted again, and no update tab. And, restarted again, and no update tab.
Fixed for now. 

Thanks very much, Tony.
