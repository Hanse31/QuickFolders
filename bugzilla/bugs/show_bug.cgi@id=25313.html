tabs showing: new mail, unread, and no unread

Running QuickFolders 3.10 on Thunderbird 17.0.2 on Ubuntu 12.04.

I have the &quot;Highlight folders with new mail&quot; option enabled, but the appearance
difference between folders with and without new mail is hardly noticeable. It
appears as if folders with new mail have a sort of gray outline around the tab
label. See attached screen shot.

I thought it was simply a display artifact until I started playing with the
&quot;Highlight folders with new mail&quot; option and did an A-B comparison.

Is there any reason why you didn't simply echo the new mail highlighting scheme
used by Thunderbird itself? They use bold for unread and bold red for new mail.
See second attached screen shot.

Is there a way to customize the highlight appearance?

new mail appearance when colors are used

Here is an example of the &quot;new mail highlighting&quot; style, when used with colored
tabs. I needed to go for a style that did not use color itself as that would
get lost, also I didn't necessarily want to overwrite icons (as you can see I
use them quite extensively). Therefore I want for the &quot;inner shadow&quot; solution.
Can you suggest a way of styling that is color and icon independent?

Wow, that's busy looking. I looked at it for a while and I think &quot;GMail&quot; is the
folder that's supposed to be indicating new mail?



<span class="quote">&gt; I needed to go for a style that did not use color itself as that would
&gt; get lost...</span >

Ah, I see the challenge.


<span class="quote">&gt; ...also I didn't necessarily want to overwrite icons...
&gt; Can you suggest a way of styling that is color and icon independent?</span >

One obvious solution is the one TB uses itself. You place a red asterisk in the
upper right corner of the tab, as it once did (2.0-era) on folders with new
mail. (Want a screen shot? I still have a TB 2.0 installation available.) The
graphic could overlay and partially obscure the label, and thus not require a
width change.

Another option is to get annoying with blinking text or background color.

But what I'm wondering is whether you necessarily need a universal mechanism.
If you provided a few options, including font and coloring style changes, then
the user could pick whatever worked best with the color scheme they used.

I would add a button to the &quot;Bling my Tabs!&quot; dialog for &quot;New Mail Tab Color&quot;
below active, hover, and drag. (More thoughts on &quot;Bling my Tabs!&quot; in a separate
ticket.)

In my opinion, the default display of tabs in a newly installed QuickFolders
should replicate the standard styling of TB's folder tree as much as possible
(if it doesn't already do so; I don't recall), which should result in a
functional combination of colors.

The custom colored tabs are more of a special case.

I'll give that a spin. Thanks.

Sounds good to me, as long as I can implement it css-only. I have a fairly
powerful styling engine under the QuickFolders bonnet with which I can insert /
modify css rules &quot;on the fly&quot;. It gets much more tricky if you want to insert
new DOM elements. So if it can be solved with background-image or
list-style-image I would be willing to upload a test version.

no its fine - I would have went for the green circle (which is the default for
new mail at least on the windows theme) as it is fairly universal. But a golden
star would be possible as well.

true. italics might be an option as well?

&gt; I would add a button to the &quot;Bling my Tabs!&quot; dialog for &quot;New Mail Tab Color&quot;
&gt; below active, hover, and drag. (More thoughts on &quot;Bling my Tabs!&quot; in a separate
&gt; ticket.)</span >

Yes that whole tab is a bit of a mess (and I dare say about 85% of the
development time went into that for the last 2 releases). It is already quite
complicated, and one of my goals for the future would be to support mixing
different color palettes (at the moment normal and pastel) per tab to make them
&quot;stand out&quot; more. But that will not only add complexity to the code (which is
manageable) but to the User Interface, which is much harder to implement
elegantly. And I'd rather have less features than an unusable UI.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, the default display of tabs in a newly installed QuickFolders
&gt; should replicate the standard styling of TB's folder tree as much as possible
&gt; (if it doesn't already do so; I don't recall), which should result in a
&gt; functional combination of colors.</span >
It _should_, but: One thing that is tricky about this is that it is both OS
dependent and dependent on the theme. On top of that, each theme has a
different way of implementing things like icons (some use image maps, some
list-style-image, some background, etc.) it is almost impossible to do this in
a meaningful manner without a huge amount of theme / OS specific hard-coding.


<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; The custom colored tabs are more of a special case.</span >

yep; the original layout was only striped colors, a fairly unique layout I came
up with when I took over  n I will upload a screenshot of that as well, so you
get idea what that would look like.

What about using either or both of bold and italic text for the tab title
depending on circumstances? For instance, bold for unread, bold italic for new
mail (which is always unread)? — Ah, wait, italic is already used if the
folder isn't empty (or if it is empty except for a subfolder). Underlined,
then? Or somehow customize via the options dialog (with defaults being what is
in use now) what to use bold, italic, and underline for?

underlined = current folder.

I never liked italic for &quot;not empty&quot;, that's one of the original options from
Alex - what's the point of bookmarking an empty folder? I would almost like to
scrap &quot;italics&quot; for that purpose and reuse it for &quot;new unread mail&quot;.

<span class="quote">&gt; Or somehow customize via the options dialog (with defaults being what is

that would be possible since none of them are mutex. it would mean adding 3
dropdowns (instead of checkboxes); and I could possibly also add the &quot;inset
shadow&quot; that I am currently using for &quot;new unread&quot;, although that one is a
little more complex. Also, I don't want to totally frighten my users with
complexity on the General tab.


For the moment, I prefer scrapping 
&quot;Display tabs for folders which contain messages italic&quot;
for
&quot;Display tabs with newly arrived mail italic&quot;

(I am open to suggestions for better wordings)

of course I wouldn't know what the pushback from existing users would be :]

Axel Grude wrote:

The problem with italics is that it is subtle. More so than bold, and much more
so than bold + red.

In my opinion, styling of the following attributes should go from most visible
to least visible:

new mail
unread mail
normal, and everything else.

When I look at the TB folder tree, I can easily spot folders with new mail from
10 feet away from my monitor. If they were italics instead of red bold text, I
couldn't.

I don't see much value in that particular indicator, though it does appear to
be replicating a styling cue used by TB in its folder tree.

Identifying an empty folder is a low importance attribute, and thus italic is a
good fit.

I guess my TB (17) theme uses a golden star. Unfortunately its more subtle than
the red star used in TB 2.0 and thus I hadn't really noticed it until I went
looking for it today.

But whatever matches the TB theme would make sense.

I looked at your posting with the CSS after suggesting the image idea, and I
see your in-line comments indicate that you weren't able to get it to work. If
that's the case, then there doesn't seem to be a point in further discussing
the particular graphic choice until the underlying CSS problem can be figured
out.


<span class="quote">&gt;&gt; ...default display...should replicate the standard styling
&gt;&gt; of TB's folder tree...
&gt; It _should_, but: One thing that is tricky about this is that it is both OS

Yeah, I figured it wouldn't be easy.

Assuming theming works by applying styles to CSS selectors tagged onto various
UI elements, like say folder labels, what problems do you run into when you try
and inherit those same styles for equivalent UI elements?

Can you poke into TB's UI and extract the applied styling and then replicate
it?


<span class="quote">&gt; same with striped style, normal colors (not pastel)</span >

So &quot;GMail&quot; and &quot;SmartTemplates&quot; are the tabs showing new mail? They do stand
out, but the white on gray text is poorly legible.


<span class="quote">&gt; here is a screenshot from a prototype</span >

So this shows new mail in &quot;GMail.&quot; The tab does stand out, but not for the
italic text, but because the whole background is green, while all other tabs
just have color stripes.

The colorful, busy nature of the tab style you are using pretty much makes it
an uphill battle to make any indicator stand out.

I get the appeal of using color to coordinate things, but seeing it in use does
make me wonder if there is a better way to accomplish the same thing. Visually,
categorization should be at a more subtle level than status indicator.

For example, use physical positioning. Insert separators between groups of
tabs, and/or put them on different rows in a user controlled way.

If the user needs extensive categorization, then QuikFolders, at least as
implemented as tabs, is going to hit a limit. One can imagine an alternate
implementation for QuickFolders where it is shown as a custom hierarchy of
folders that replace the main folder tree. This would essentially be the same
idea as &quot;favorite folders&quot; that was implemented in earlier versions of TB (no
sign of it in 17), which I tried for a while, but something about it fell
short.

Sounds OK to me, and neither can I predict the pushback.

Of course it is already possible to show unread and total messages by
displaying their numbers (there are two checkboxes for that in the options
dialog — and a third one for &quot;totals of subfolders&quot;) but it takes up room: I
used to have both on, but nowadays I don't display the total number of messages
per folder so that all my QF tabs remain on one row. It may be less of a
problem for other people depending on how many QF tabs they use.

Guess your eye seight is better than mine. But I must say that, if sitting in
front of the monitor, a quick scan reveals all unread folders to me - I really
think an additional, unique (and maybe color configurable, with a choice of red
gold and blue) icon on the top right of the label would be the best solution;
everything else just doesn't stick out enough to me.

well, tabs are tabs, and they are much easier to drag &amp; drop to, they will

categories, when he still contributed to the project as programmer. You
probably noticed the dropdown on the left hand side of my other screenshots. I
am using the following categories:

Addons
Family
Friends
Groups+Registrations
IMAP
Inboxes
Mozilla
Music, Studio
Shopping
Work
[Smart Folders]

, and a couple of test ones.

Since each tab can be member of multiple groups you can tailor QuickFolders to
show tabs that are suited to certain work task without loosing view on your
most important ones [WORKSFORME {tm}]. I have to say though that I hardly ever
leave email unread and I am using the navigation keys, mainly [N], to jump to
the next unread email about 50% of the time to make sure I did not &quot;miss&quot; any
folder that has new mail. 

I believe there is another bug that requests &quot;pinning&quot; certain tabs if they
contain unread mail, regardless of their category, but that's a different
discussion.

that was the currently open folder, which is one feature of the striped theme.
To me knowing the current folder has even higher priority than any of the other

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I see something change in the styling of the &quot;Highlight folders with new mail&quot;

Maybe the styling replicated my default styling, and thus no change was

Now when a tab has new mail, I see a black background with a gradient, and the
folder label in white, bold text, that has poor legibility (due to the
gradient).

I headed over to the &quot;Bling My Tabs!&quot; settings expecting to find an option to

Reading through this ticket, I see customizing for mail state was never an
option. Only options for default, active, hover, and drag states. Isn't
customization of the appearance of mail states equally important, if not more
so? Day-to-day, I rarely ever encounter or care about the appearance of hover
and drag states.

Is this still something I can customize via CSS? If so, I'll replicate the
current styling TB (31.5) uses, which is using red text for the folder name
when there is new mail present (applied in addition to the bold text styling
indicating there is unread mail present).

We could add a configurable font color for this case, but it might not be a

I have seen the &quot;New mail&quot; notification on other systems but not too often on
my own.

COlored folder:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/yOB6gQT.png">http://i.imgur.com/yOB6gQT.png</a>
Same on uncolored folder:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/pXbbTTn.png">http://i.imgur.com/pXbbTTn.png</a>

the question is, will there be a color that will look sufficiently readable for
darkly colored and bright colored folders alike? I fear neithe a white nor a
black font will cut it for all cases.


One thing I could think of is adding a text-shadow rule:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/7yxV5Xd.png">http://i.imgur.com/7yxV5Xd.png</a>

this should increase legibility and work equally on dark and bright
backgrounds.

To try it out:

#QuickFolders-Toolbar toolbarbutton[biffState-NewMail].has-unread &gt; label
{
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(40, 40, 40, 0.8) !important;
}

well. This could replace the customized icon or maybe (?) be shown inside the

For the subset of people who use colored tabs as an organizational tool. (I
don't happen to be one of them. In my opinion, colored tabs should be an
advance or non-default setting, and it should be the responsibility of the user
selecting colors to work around conflicts with stock styling, or be willing to
alter the stock styling. Much the same way someone choosing to use all dark
background colors would need to switch to a light font color. Hey, don't you
support the concept of palettes? Couldn't each pallet include complementary
attribute styling to match?)


<span class="quote">&gt; That's why this styling was added
&gt; via the &quot;Inner&quot; label and a yellow star icon...</span >

Using the graphic icon exclusively as the default way to show new mail would
get my vote, as far as a least-effort solution. It accomplishes the job is a
highly visible way and works with all background colors.

If you want to put more time into it, adding the ability to configure the
styling from the bling dialog would be a welcome improvement.

And requiring yet more effort: having QuickFolders introspect TB's styling and
replicate it for the tabs, including the new mail notification, would be ideal.
This way if I recommend QuickFolders to a colleague, I can have confidence that
when they first install it, it will seamlessly blend in with TBs styling
without requiring any appearance customization effort.


<span class="quote">&gt; =&gt; there is &quot;Display tabs with newly arrived mail in italics&quot; already as an
&gt; option on the General Tab!!</span >

Ah, I overlooked that. But it is applied in addition to the other styling
changes for new mail, and compared to the background change and shadowing
effect, italics are pretty subtle.

That works as intended. I see the star and the label text is more legible.

I'd still prefer an unaltered background with red text. (With or without the
star.) If that doesn't fit your vision, that's fine. It looks like the CSS
hooks are adequate that I can customize that way, which I don't mind doing.

I appreciate the quick turn-around on the tweaked version.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >FYI, I loaded up my userChrome.css to make the customizations of QuickFolders,
and I see I had entries there for the main TB folder tree:

/* Folder Pane Color for New Mail */
treechildren::-moz-tree-cell-text(folderNameCol, newMessages-true) {
color: #A51010 !important;
}

This causes folders with new mail to show as a shade of red. I don't recall
when I added that. It looks like he default is to show folders with new mail in
a shade of blue.

I mention this because I referenced this styling in my prior comments. The idea
of having QuickFolders replicate the styling used by TB is obviously more
complicated if those default style has been customized via userChrome.css.
(Although if TB provides adequate access to the DOM nodes or computed CSS, QF
could still replicate the styles actually in use.)


I ended up adding the following rules to userChrome.css to have QF replicate
the style used in my folder tree:

#QuickFolders-Toolbar toolbarbutton[biffState-NewMail].has-unread &gt; label,
#QuickFolders-Toolbar menu[biffState-NewMail].hasUnread,
#QuickFolders-Toolbar menuitem[biffState-NewMail].hasUnread
{
  box-shadow: none !important;
  text-shadow: none !important;
  border-style: none !important;
  color: #A51010 !important;
}

I didn't feel strongly for or against the star icon, so I left it. It's
superfluous, but having it is consistent with what TB does, which is to alter
the folder icon to show a star.


I'm just glad to see the new mail notification working in QF now, which it
hadn't been for a long time. (Not sure if that's because the default styling
resulted in no visible change, or an incompatibility with Linux, but whatever
the case, it hadn't been working prior to the last QF update.)

Well that's one case. I meant to reply earlier - it is actually very very
difficult when you are also throw in full themes into the mix. I would like my
interfaces to be usable at least in my favorite themes Nautipolis, Walnut2 and
TT deepdark. So what might look great on Windows with Aero enabled might not
actually be a great choice for Mac OS or Ubuntu with a dark skin. Themes have
no standard mechanism for coloring backgrounds some use background image on a
lower level or various gradients overlapping each other, everybody uses
slightly different selectors so it is extremely difficult to find out the exact
style that needs to be undone. 

Lazy UI designers will resort to attaching an !important rule to any and all of
their styles, I try to avoid this as much as possible so that themes can
override these settings and are able to blend in my own designs better with
their vision / color choice. 

That's also why I chose not to use the &quot;color channel&quot; for this important new
mail status and was looking for something that would override and work with all
custom colors; shadows and sometimes borders are really a good choice here as
they integrate very well with all color choices. A dark shadow (for bright
text) might be invisible on a dark background but it may just be the saving
grace when using a bright one. 

Another problem is that you often cannot even trust the OS-specific colose
(such as menu highlight) as they can be abused by the OS skin for other
purposes. From my own experience I would rather have the user decide for a
color chocie for certain things (like active folder) and pick the color
themselves. A lot of &quot;clever&quot; system color choices make assumptions based on OS
such as bright blue transparent background in Windows Aero - and so they might
think that dark text will always work. They do not take into acocunt that the
Aero engine can be completely restyled (I am using Windowblinds) to look like
Mac or Unix or any fantasy UI (e.g. Startrek). 


<span class="quote">&gt; (Although if TB provides adequate access to the DOM nodes or computed CSS, QF
&gt; could still replicate the styles actually in use.)</span >

Computed CSS may help with certain things like font color; but sadly background
appearance is much more complicated than this. You have multiple layers which
can be transparent, so although your label element might be rgba(20,90,180,0.3)
it will still let the background color of a button (which might have a
transparent linear gradient) shine through. that button might be partly
translucent and depend on the hbox (or canvas) that it is one, which might be
bright yellow. So who is to say what resulting &quot;background color&quot; this label
will have? This is a highly complex beast, and the longer I worked with it the
more certain I can say that nothing is predictable.

&gt; I ended up adding the following rules to userChrome.css to have QF replicate
&gt; the style used in my folder tree:
&gt; 
&gt; #QuickFolders-Toolbar toolbarbutton[biffState-NewMail].has-unread &gt; label,
&gt; #QuickFolders-Toolbar menu[biffState-NewMail].hasUnread,
&gt; #QuickFolders-Toolbar menuitem[biffState-NewMail].hasUnread
&gt; {
&gt;   box-shadow: none !important;
&gt;   text-shadow: none !important;
&gt;   border-style: none !important;
&gt;   color: #A51010 !important;
&gt; }</span >

[biffState-NewMail] is definitely the correct track. I would suggest you look
at styling background-color or background-image as well in order to avoid &quot;bad
surprises&quot;. It is always problematic to define a text color without specifying
background with it. However you have a choice whether you doe this on the
button (menu) level or lower down on the actual textnode. (Enable anonymous
nodes in DOM inspector to take your pick)


<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; I didn't feel strongly for or against the star icon, so I left it. It's
&gt; superfluous, but having it is consistent with what TB does, which is to alter
&gt; the folder icon to show a star.</span >

I agree. The one I chose is a little &quot;clunky&quot; so at some stage I might make
this configurable. I kind of like a fixed color (like gold in this case) as it
is a good anchoring point when I change themes often.


<span class="quote">&gt; I'm just glad to see the new mail notification working in QF now, which it
&gt; hadn't been for a long time. (Not sure if that's because the default styling
&gt; resulted in no visible change, or an incompatibility with Linux, but whatever
&gt; the case, it hadn't been working prior to the last QF update.)</span >

I think it had to do with CSS specificity - but also I might have made a
leveling mistake with that icon. The fix is definitely going into the next
release, rather sooner than later.
