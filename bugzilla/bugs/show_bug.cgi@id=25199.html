<pre class="bz_comment_text" >if, e.g., for my work, I have one filter already, when I drag a new message to
my work folder, it will look for the rule I created previously with
quickFilters and add the details there... (suggestion: this could be based on
the target folder; if filters already move mail to my work folder they are
candidates to add this new rule)

I don't know whether the template assistant screen would be necessary (though
maybe not bad for an option). I kind of like just being brought directly to the
filter and would like that page to dynamically update so when I choose, e.g.,
Subject, it grabs the current subject.

I think I would find it easier if the &quot;template assistant&quot; could instead be a
preference which controlled which fields were populated by default. E.g., if I
didn't want both the To and From populating, I could control that. Maybe these
prefs could moreover be sensitive to context, so that if say adding a Work
filter, it would use the sender, but when adding a Junk filter, it would look
by default at the subject.

Also, not sure whether to file a new issue, and I haven't even confirmed it
carefully, but it seems that when I am inside a Saved Search folder (as is
common for me--no matter with Inbox, Drafts, or aggregating other folders),
dragging doesn't seem to be aware of original location (it instead adds the
filter to Local Folders where the filter is never used). That would be very
helpful.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Accepted - sounds good. Potentially it is complex, but initially it can be just
based on the target folder. We need to flesh out what it does exactly:

1. if one match is found - it is still important which criteria of the original
email is relevant (that's the whole point of the Template Screen); so I would
not (at least initially) try to do anything clever and parse the existing
filter rules to &quot;guess&quot; what other criteria to use. Also what if the user wants
to create a separate rule, should there be a choice in this case?

2. if two or more matches are found - well ideally it would try to consolidate
them all into one, but again, too much work for the one try, so I propose I
display a listbox with just the matching filter names; and the user can select
which one to choose.

3. As regards  higher granularity for the criteria - this is a bit of a sticky
one, as one the one hand I want to keep the template screen &quot;light weight&quot; so
there is not too much thinking &amp; clicking involved; overcrowding with many
checkboxes / options would do just that. On the other hand it would be dead
handy if the user could make her own templates - so maybe that is something for
another bug. As regards &quot;merging&quot; the rules, the existing Templates would
already be quite good, e.g. if I have post from a mailing list which uses
different keywords in subject lines, e.g.
1. [mozilla reviews]
2. [AMO editors]
say I have created a filter with rule 1. (using the subject rule)
later I decide I want a filter based on 2 - again using the subject rule it
would open the existing filter and add if subject contains [AMO editors] (using
the or condition)

======================
Lastly, regarding the &quot;Saved Search folder&quot; or &quot;Local Folder&quot; not recognizing
the source folder correctly, can you please file a separate bug? I don't want
to mix several things into the same bug, rather split them up into manageable
chunks.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Sorry for the long discussion, but I've tried to give it a fair bit of thought.
I think I really prefer configuring things by folder, as this seems it would
work well with the already-existing QuickFolders context menu.

Also pardon me, if I may sometimes have confused QuickFilters with
QuickFolders, but I tend to find them most useful together (and I am talking
about the filtering behavior here).

In my reply below, I've reordered your replies to group similar subfeatures
together (in order from general to specific):
1) Rule merging discussion
2) Target folder discussion
3) Criteria discussion

1) RULE MERGING DISCUSSION

<span class="quote">&gt; &quot;Also what if the user wants
&gt; to create a separate rule, should there be a choice in this case?&quot;&quot;</span >

Maybe the best solution (both allowing UI visibility as well as &quot;set and
forget&quot; convenience) would be to have the default behavior be folder-specific
with the choice between merging or not merging by default being changeable when
right-clicking the folder in the toolbar. So if I drag to my Junk folder, it
could say merge by default (assuming a target folder filter exists), but
dragging to Work would create separate rules. 

The latter could be helpful in cases when the Criteria Template (see below) for
the given folder involved multiple AND criteria which could not be readily
merged (e.g., if I had two Trash folders on the toolbar, one for single-rule
junk, and one for multiple rules, e.g., to confirm that the user was not in my
address book before deleting a message with the subject &quot;Hello&quot;).

Maybe a meta key could allow override of the default (e.g., dragging with
&quot;shift&quot; could either merge or avoid merging). The toolbar text could ideally
change temporarily during the drag to indicate what the behavior was going to
be.

2) TARGET FOLDER DISCUSSION

<span class="quote">&gt; &quot;Potentially it is complex, but initially it can be just based on the target 
&gt; folder...&quot;</span >

Yes, sounds good. I think you'd also have to decide whether to support Move to
Folder, Copy to Folder, etc. as options. 

Hopefully, it could find the target even if it is not the first step (since,
e.g., I like to mark junk as read before moving it to the Trash, so it doesn't
alert me in the same way as there are new messages, but so that it isn't fully
deleted in case someone later informs me that a message was missing).

<span class="quote">&gt; &quot;if two or more matches are found - well ideally it would try to consolidate
&gt; them all into one, but again, too much work for the one try, so I propose I
&gt; display a listbox with just the matching filter names; and the user can select
&gt; which one to choose.&quot;</span >

Good idea. The dialog might be subdivided perhaps by &quot;Copy to Folder&quot;, &quot;Move to
Folder&quot;, &quot;Forward to Folder&quot; filters depending on how the Target folder was
specified for quicker identification.

I think a &quot;Use this choice for future filters&quot; checkbox could help users avoid
the need for a dialog in future cases (though holding down say the control key
when dragging could always require it). 

As above, holding down the key when dragging might ideally change the text of
the toolbar so one knew what was going to happen after dropping.

Alternatively, or better yet, in addition, right-clicking a folder in the
toolbar could indicate what the active filter was for this merge mode and allow
resetting it.

3) CRITERIA DISCUSSION

<span class="quote">&gt; &quot;if one match is found - it is still important which criteria of the original
&gt; email is relevant (that's the whole point of the Template Screen); so I would
&gt; not (at least initially) try to do anything clever and parse the existing
&gt; filter rules to &quot;guess&quot; what other criteria to use.&quot;</span >

In my view, the fight against spam via filters is only effective to the extent
that extra steps can be avoided, at least after one has set some default
behavior.

But I am not envisaging any complex parsing here.

The first idea does not involve any parsing. When you are in Mozilla's normal
&quot;Filter Rules&quot; dialog, the default behavior when you switch from say &quot;Subject&quot;
to &quot;From&quot; is to erase whatever you already started typing in that area.  My
idea here is to override this behavior to retrieve the currently highlighted
email's properties. So if I switch to &quot;From&quot;, it will pull the &quot;From&quot; from the
current email. I think this is a far more useful behavior than the default in
TB which simply empties the text, or requiring an intermediate dialog. (I would
also like to see this work with the useful Filtaquilla extesion items, e.g.,
Subject Regex would pull the current Subject, though escaping for regex special
chars. by default.) 

If one wanted a new behavior (e.g., to copy from one highlighted field to
another), I think they can be added as new criteria rules in this Filter Rules
dialog--e.g., &quot;To (based on From)&quot;.

Note that your template behavior of setting both &quot;From&quot; and &quot;To&quot; can be
replicated here as well since there is an option (added by Filtaquilla?) for
&quot;From, To, Cc, or Bcc&quot;.

But when one really does need to group multiple rules into a template (e.g.,
checking address book and the subject), I think this can be achieved by another
option available on the toolbar folder-specific context-menu, allowing you to
choose which filter pattern is chosen by default (if any) when in non-merge
mode and dragging to that folder.

And when one is not in merge mode, and does not have any filters specified for
non-merge mode, I still think it is useful to be able to be brought to the
filters dialog without needing to go through the Assistant (at least if
changing the criteria in the TB Filter Rules dialog could work as described
above to grab from the current email's contents as relevant by any change or
addition of criteria). Rather than requiring one to temporarily disable the
QuickFilters Assistant, the toolbar folder context menu (and/or a global
preference) could determine whether the Template dialog appears when no filter
is set for merge mode or non-merge mode.

<span class="quote">&gt; &quot;As regards  higher granularity for the criteria - this is a bit of a sticky
&gt; one, as one the one hand I want to keep the template screen &quot;light weight&quot; so
&gt; there is not too much thinking &amp; clicking involved; overcrowding with many
&gt; checkboxes / options would do just that. On the other hand it would be dead
&gt; handy if the user could make her own templates - so maybe that is something
&gt; for another bug.&quot;</span >

I think the above folder-aware proposals would avoid my need for additional
templates, but I think this ought to be possible without too much complexity by
patterning it after the Message Filters dialog: just list the choices, but also
have buttons to Add New, Edit, etc.

<span class="quote">&gt; &quot;As regards &quot;merging&quot; the rules, the existing Templates would
&gt; already be quite good, e.g. if I have post from a mailing list which uses
&gt; different keywords in subject lines, e.g.
&gt; 1. [mozilla reviews]
&gt; 2. [AMO editors]
&gt; say I have created a filter with rule 1. (using the subject rule)
&gt; later I decide I want a filter based on 2 - again using the subject rule it
&gt; would open the existing filter and add if subject contains [AMO editors] 
&gt; (using the or condition)&quot;</span >

Sure, though I don't understand the part about the brackets. There don't appear
to be any brackets when creating such a Subject rule though the Assistant seems
to suggest there will be. I guess if the Assistant allows editing of templates,
only single-filter rules or rules exclusively using OR could be available when
in merge mode.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >A few replies, off-the cuff. Hopefully we will be able to discuss these in more
detail. Just as a general comment; I will still need to balance your
suggestions with the need of keeping the tool simple enough for the average
user and the limited amount of time that I can give to developing and
supporting complicated features - so if i have a choice of 2 solutions to
resolve a particular requirement, I will usually pick the &quot;simpler&quot; / more
efficient one. 

That said, let me get to on to some detail...

(In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi@id=25199.html#c2">comment #2</a>)
<span class="quote">&gt; Sorry for the long discussion, but I've tried to give it a fair bit of thought.
&gt; I think I really prefer configuring things by folder, as this seems it would
&gt; work well with the already-existing QuickFolders context menu.</span >

hmm, not sure what you mean, I do not intend to introduce &quot;Meta&quot;-behavior that
shows different options depending on which folder you drag mail to; (If this is
what you mean) to program and configure this would simply be more work than
benefit.

<span class="quote">&gt; 1) RULE MERGING DISCUSSION
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;Also what if the user wants
&gt; &gt; to create a separate rule, should there be a choice in this case?&quot;&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the best solution (both allowing UI visibility as well as &quot;set and
&gt; forget&quot; convenience) would be to have the default behavior be folder-specific
&gt; with the choice between merging or not merging by default being changeable when
&gt; right-clicking the folder in the toolbar. So if I drag to my Junk folder, it
&gt; could say merge by default (assuming a target folder filter exists), but
&gt; dragging to Work would create separate rules. </span >

So what you are saying is that I only suggest certain templates based on target
folder type. This might be beneficial if there were a lot of different
templates (not just 5) but even then I am not to sure whether it would not just
overcomplicate things. I would put that at the bottom of the priority list.

<span class="quote">&gt; ... in cases when the Criteria Template (see below) for
&gt; the given folder involved multiple AND criteria which could not be readily
&gt; merged (e.g., if I had two Trash folders on the toolbar, one for single-rule
&gt; junk, and one for multiple rules, e.g., to confirm that the user was not in my
&gt; address book before deleting a message with the subject &quot;Hello&quot;).</span >

There needs to be a discussion of AND versus OR anyway, initially I would only
attempt to merge using the OR rule. This would also mean avoiding merging with
any rule that contains &quot;AND&quot; as operator - for this case I prefer the user to
go and edit the rule manually. There _could_ be an alert for such filters but
not sure how beneficial it would be.

I know that filters do actually support &quot;mixing&quot; AND and OR, but currently
there is no user interface to &quot;build&quot; or edit such rules. For the moment, let's
concentrate on the OR case. More complicated behavior could be discussed in
separate bugs (after initial implementation or beta)

<span class="quote">&gt; 2) TARGET FOLDER DISCUSSION
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;Potentially it is complex, but initially it can be just based on the target 
&gt; &gt; folder...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, sounds good. I think you'd also have to decide whether to support Move to
&gt; Folder, Copy to Folder, etc. as options. </span >

True, and this can be based on the action of the user (whether [s]he moves or
copied the mails). There is a plan to also create filters based on adding Tags,
but that one is for the future and out of scope for this bug.

<span class="quote">&gt; Hopefully, it could find the target even if it is not the first step (since,
&gt; e.g., I like to mark junk as read before moving it to the Trash, so it doesn't
&gt; alert me in the same way as there are new messages, but so that it isn't fully
&gt; deleted in case someone later informs me that a message was missing).</span >

Sorry, that went over my head :) Anyway, the action that creates the merge is
&quot;move to folder&quot; so marking as junk is not even detected. But if &quot;Mark as Junk&quot;
would move mail to the Junk folder automatically this might be something that
qF wants to detect (out of scope for this bug)

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;if two or more matches are found - well ideally it would try to consolidate
&gt; &gt; them all into one, but again, too much work for the one try, so I propose I
&gt; &gt; display a listbox with just the matching filter names; and the user can select
&gt; &gt; which one to choose.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Good idea. The dialog might be subdivided perhaps by &quot;Copy to Folder&quot;, &quot;Move to
&gt; Folder&quot;, &quot;Forward to Folder&quot; filters depending on how the Target folder was
&gt; specified for quicker identification.</span >

sounds complicated. I imagine a simple listbox with names, and when you click
on an item you get a detail pane summarizing the conditions of the selected
one. imo, the filter action (move/copy/fwd) is not really so important (but
could be displayed as part of the named list if you think it is valuable)

<span class="quote">&gt; I think a &quot;Use this choice for future filters&quot; checkbox could help users avoid
&gt; the need for a dialog in future cases (though holding down say the control key
&gt; when dragging could always require it). </span >

It already does this with the template (selects last template chose, e.g. by
subject). As regards merging, the manual step of selecting the filter should
also always be there to avoid nasty surprises.  If the user learns &quot;to trust&quot;
the process [s]he can simply click [Continue&gt;] always.

I am all for making things easy but also don't want to take away control from
the users.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; As above, holding down the key when dragging might ideally change the text of
&gt; the toolbar so one knew what was going to happen after dropping.</span >

I wouldn't propose to look at modifiers as a source for different &quot;templating /
merging&quot; behavior as there is already an abundance of key modifiers attached to
drag'n drop for emails (move / copy) and QuickFolders. This would just
complicate the issue too much and wouldn't be worth the effort.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, or better yet, in addition, right-clicking a folder in the
&gt; toolbar could indicate what the active filter was for this merge mode and allow
&gt; resetting it.</span >

I think this is a good idea - right-click a folder (from folder-tree) to find
any related filters (target and source). Can you suggest this as a separate bug
please? It could then also be integrated into QuickFolders. Potentially this is
a complicated one, but it is definitely valuable!

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; 3) CRITERIA DISCUSSION
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;if one match is found - it is still important which criteria of the original

&gt; idea here is to override this behavior to retrieve the currently highlighted
&gt; email's properties.</span >

Yes, you are mirroring my ideas exactly - I was thinking about this for a long
time - dropping down a different filter criteria _should_ auto-populate the
value field. Again, please raise a separate bug in quickFilters, as this is
independant from the &quot;Merge&quot; discussion. I am trying to compartmentalize this
work in order to track and implement everything faster and with less regression
issues.

<span class="quote">&gt; So if I switch to &quot;From&quot;, it will pull the &quot;From&quot; from the
&gt; current email. I think this is a far more useful behavior than the default in
&gt; TB which simply empties the text, or requiring an intermediate dialog. </span >

Did you notice the parsing I have implemented for the &quot;Subject&quot; template? It
parses out {bracketed expressions}, which I find quite useful... but I am open
to more ideas in the field of retrieving valid info from the mail headers.


<span class="quote">&gt; (I would also like to see this work with the useful Filtaquilla extesion items, e.g.,
&gt; Subject Regex would pull the current Subject, though escaping for regex special
&gt; chars. by default.) </span >

Regex behavior is complicated, and not well understood by many users. So let's
put that one on the back burner.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; If one wanted a new behavior (e.g., to copy from one highlighted field to
&gt; another), I think they can be added as new criteria rules in this Filter Rules
&gt; dialog--e.g., &quot;To (based on From)&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that your template behavior of setting both &quot;From&quot; and &quot;To&quot; can be
&gt; replicated here as well since there is an option (added by Filtaquilla?) for
&gt; &quot;From, To, Cc, or Bcc&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; But when one really does need to group multiple rules into a template (e.g.,
&gt; checking address book and the subject), I think this can be achieved by another
&gt; option available on the toolbar folder-specific context-menu, allowing you to
&gt; choose which filter pattern is chosen by default (if any) when in non-merge
&gt; mode and dragging to that folder.</span >

that's way complicated; even I find this hard to understand, how would a mere
mortal [read &quot;user&quot;]? :)

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; And when one is not in merge mode, and does not have any filters specified for
&gt; non-merge mode, I still think it is useful to be able to be brought to the
&gt; filters dialog without needing to go through the Assistant (at least if
&gt; changing the criteria in the TB Filter Rules dialog could work as described
&gt; above to grab from the current email's contents as relevant by any change or
&gt; addition of criteria). Rather than requiring one to temporarily disable the
&gt; QuickFilters Assistant, the toolbar folder context menu (and/or a global
&gt; preference) could determine whether the Template dialog appears when no filter
&gt; is set for merge mode or non-merge mode.</span >

If I understand you correctly, you say you want to disable the Filter Template
behavior for certain folders? Not sure, this means you would like to leave on
Filter Teach mode for a long time (I usually only have it on for 2 or 3 emails,
when I tidy up my inbox). 

Or do you mean we only activate the filter assistant &quot;If there is already a
filter with this target folder defined&quot;? Not sure I follow you there. But I am
reluctant (for the reasons outlined above) to expose different behaviors (and
configuration options) for qF on a per folder basis. The behavior should be
purely based on whether there are already filters defined or not - if not, the
step of &quot;choose filter to merge&quot; will simply be omitted.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;As regards  higher granularity for the criteria - this is a bit of a sticky
&gt; &gt; one, as one the one hand I want to keep the template screen &quot;light weight&quot; so
&gt; &gt; there is not too much thinking &amp; clicking involved; overcrowding with many
&gt; &gt; checkboxes / options would do just that. On the other hand it would be dead
&gt; &gt; handy if the user could make her own templates - so maybe that is something
&gt; &gt; for another bug.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I think the above folder-aware proposals would avoid my need for additional
&gt; templates, but I think this ought to be possible without too much complexity by
&gt; patterning it after the Message Filters dialog: just list the choices, but also
&gt; have buttons to Add New, Edit, etc.</span >

Can you be more concrete? Again I am not sure which dialog or page you refer
to, maybe talk me through one example? Or attach a screenshot...

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;As regards &quot;merging&quot; the rules, the existing Templates would
&gt; &gt; already be quite good, e.g. if I have post from a mailing list which uses
&gt; &gt; different keywords in subject lines, e.g.
&gt; &gt; 1. [mozilla reviews]
&gt; &gt; 2. [AMO editors]
&gt; &gt; say I have created a filter with rule 1. (using the subject rule)
&gt; &gt; later I decide I want a filter based on 2 - again using the subject rule it
&gt; &gt; would open the existing filter and add if subject contains [AMO editors] 
&gt; &gt; (using the or condition)&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, though I don't understand the part about the brackets. There don't appear
&gt; to be any brackets when creating such a Subject rule though the Assistant seems
&gt; to suggest there will be. </span >

Quite a few mailing lists (and also a bunch of support hotlines) use bracketed
prefixes to make their emails easy to find. Here are some example subject lines
from my inbox:

1.6.2, prerelease 21

Here is a very rough version of what I hope will be usable for this feature
request. If a matching filter is found the list of matches is displayed. It is
possible to select _one_ or no entry from the list, then the button [Next] has
to be clicked.

If an item is selected the button text changes to [Edit Filter...]
If no item is selected the button text changes to [Create Filter...]

On [Edit Filter...] the selected filter will be opened for editing and the new
conditions are added automatically. At this stage, I do not check for
duplicated conditions and they shouldn't really happen as a matching filter
should already have moved the mail.

There are 2 known problems at the moment: changes to the Edited Filter are
immediate, so if in Edit Filter the [Cancel] button is clicked the new
conditions are still added and not rolled back. Also, on leaving the dialog,
the edited filter is not highlighted in the filters list. Note that all new
strings are currently hard coded in English.

One thing I would like to start thinking about, how would you provide this
functionality (merge one filter with another) from the filter list dialog? One
problem is that it is already a very overcrowded dialog, so any new tools added
would likely require a toolbar (e.g. something similar to Firefox History /
Bookmarks layout).

Then there are the following problems to solve:

1. how to find out duplicates
2. how to select which duplicates to merge (the new page on the filter
assistant might come into play here or serve as a template)
3. special rules for (re)naming the filter - this is lower priority as I would
display the Edit Filter dialog after a merge operation anyway.

Another thought is that merging filters with same action(s) usually only would
make sense if existing conditions are &quot;or-ed&quot; together. It usually wouldn't
make sense to &quot;extend&quot; a filter that has &quot;and&quot; conditions, e.g.

old rule
&quot;if sender is x and subject is t&quot;
new rule
&quot;if sender is yy&quot;

the UI does not support building
(&quot;if sender is x and subject is t&quot;) OR (&quot;if sender is yy&quot;)
and building a new condition
&quot;if sender is x and subject is t AND if sender is yy&quot;
won't work either.

So for the moment, should merging filters exclude filters with an &quot;and&quot;
condition?

1.6.2 prerelease 36

This version includes a [Merge] button on the filters list; it should only work
for filters that have the same _first_ action (usually move to folder).

I will probably simplify the interface a little but not take out the second
step.

1.6.2 pre 46

This one has the Merge button doing a real merge, including the deletion of the
merged folders. It will insert the new filter at the position of the &quot;Target&quot;
Filter that you get to select on the assistant screen. 

ON the list you can now select multiple filters even if they do not move to the
same folder - the ones that do not match will generate a warning and then once
confirmed they will be removed from the selection and only matching ones are
submitted to the assistant screen.

The merged filter will be named after the one selected on the assistant, adding
the string &quot; +m&quot;. After successful creation the Filter List is refreshed, so
that the new filter will be visible.
