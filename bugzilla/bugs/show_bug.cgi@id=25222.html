<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Axel:

A while ago I had requested a feature on Quickfilters and you responded that
the feature would be better suited to Quickfolders.

The feature I had requested was a mail alert that would remain &quot;pending&quot; until
it was acknowledged.  I think the ability to route incoming mail to specific
folders is a great idea however, on certain folders it is almost imperative
that a notice of the arrival of such mail stays visible until it is
acknowledge.  I have an alert add on now but if I'm not at my PC when mail
arrives I obviously miss seeing i.

Now, I really hope that I don't embarrass myself if you write back and inform
me that it is in there already.   I always apply the upgrades but sometimes do
not get to read all of the changes with each release.  If it's not there yet I
really hope it makes it to your &quot;to do&quot; list.

Your add=ons are great, thank you for your efforts.

Regards,

Frank

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I have renamed the title slightly, I think what you mean is that (over an above

a) manually (e.g. by a click on a context menu command such as &quot;clear new mail

b) by reading all email in the folder or using the &quot;mark all mail as read&quot;

This is something that could be stored in the quickFolder tab itself as a
special property. As a first working draft I would suggest that it should be
shown by a special &quot;flag&quot; icon, I will attach a screenshot later.

I think this is a valuable suggestion, the difficult part here is to design a
simple User Interface in a way that the ordinary user understands what this

The flag should beside a menuitem folder if 

The next obvious question is whether the flag should &quot;bubble up&quot; to parent
folders? Which is a lot more tricky to achieve but it might be necessary. The
problem is, we only store this &quot;magic property&quot; per quickFolder tab, so
currently I do not have a way to store properties without you adding the folder
as tab to at least one quickFolders category.

That's one possible way.  I was thinking about slightly differently.  Rather
than have alerts on a folder basis (all emails going to a specific folder fall
into this category) that somehow in conjunction with quickfilters that incoming
emails could be scanned on whatever criteria the user desired and an &quot;Alert&quot;
flag be assigned to be handled by Quickfolders.  

A special Qfolders Alerts tab could be used to keep track (with links) to
whatever email(s) had the Alert flag assigned.  Clicking on the link could open
the email and reset the flag.  One would only have to look at the Alerts tab to
see if there were new emails with alerts and go to the tab and click on the
desired link.  The email would be in the target folder and not have to be moved
where ever one wants it stored.  The reasoning here is that all emails that are
stored in a specific folder do not need alerts and by leaving the alert
mechanism independent of where the email gets stored is the best of both
worlds.

I fully realize that it's easy to think of lots of ways of doing things when
one doesn't need to be concerned about implementation details.

When you put up requirements, please be careful using sentences with &quot;somehow&quot;.
I cannot (yet) read minds.

So what you are saying is that you want the filter action to determine &quot;what&quot;
gets flagged, and you're not flagging a whole folder, but the individual email,
based on a filter? In that case, you can already do this - you do not need any
extension for it; in your filter, under &quot;Perform these actions&quot;, select &quot;Tag
Message&quot; and then select &quot;Important&quot; in the drop down beside it. (You can
create your own flags, so you can also name it &quot;Alert&quot; or whatever) 

<span class="quote">&gt; A special Qfolders Alerts tab could be used to keep track (with links) to
&gt; whatever email(s) had the Alert flag assigned.  </span >

Again, this is already possible, based on your &quot;tagged&quot; emails from above you
can simply make a global search based on that &quot;Important&quot; Tag and save it as
saved search folder. Move the folder to the QuickFolders bar, and voila!
Obviously this is a (search) folder full of emails, and not an individual link
to ONE email. QuickFolders currently does not support linking &quot;single emails&quot;
to it, and I am not sure if it is ever going to support it.

<span class="quote">&gt; Clicking on the link could open the email and reset the flag.  
&gt; One would only have to look at the Alerts tab to
&gt; see if there were new emails with alerts and go to the tab and click on the
&gt; desired link.</span >

So this is a little more tricky, basically what you want is to remove the
&quot;Important&quot; Tag automagically as soon as the email is viewed (when it looses
its readonly status). Not sure whether it is possible but there might be also a
way to do this with a filter... you should also download FiltaQuilla and look
at the additional options that this gives you.

You mean you failed Mindreading 101 too?  I keep telling my wife the same thing
and here I do it too.


&quot;So what you are saying is that you want the filter action to determine &quot;what&quot;
 gets flagged, and you're not flagging a whole folder, but the individual
email,
 based on a filter?&quot;

Correct.  I can then use regular expressions or the standard TB filters to flag
only the ones I want regardless of their source.  I realize I can tag an email
and create any label I want, however what I was referring to is to have a
special &quot;Alert&quot; (or any other appropriately named tag or a special QFilter
&quot;flag&quot; not associated with a TB tag) to recorded by Quickfolders in a single
place (i.e., the &quot;Alert&quot; QF Tab).  This QF special tab would know of all of the
alerts that occurred and where (folder) they were put and either be able to
open them or position me to the appropriate folder where the email was stored.

In other words, Qfolders would know about all of the Alerts that were created
via Quickfilters , have them in one place (the special &quot;QF &quot;Alerts&quot; tab or
such) and be able to &quot;magically&quot; get the user to the email when directed to do
so, however that can be done.

I'm attempting to avoid doing anymore rerouting of email than what already was
done via the filtering,  deleting dups, or keeping multiple emails around
because they went to multiple places which I believe happens with the Important
folder.

Please realize that when I opened this request it was because I remembered that
I made a request a while ago via email not through this Bugzilla so I figured
it got lost in the mill.  I didn't expect to be doing a requirements definition
right at this moment and only meant it more as an inquiry.  Had I though we
would get this far into it I would have thought it through some more.  I
apologize for that.

If it is a flag that is driven by selected emails, have a think on how this
could be implemented using the &quot;reading list&quot; function. the problem with that
feature is (while I thing it was a good idea in principle) is that I never
actually use it because it somewhat &quot;removes&quot; the important emails from my
usual flow of {go to Next unread email} =&gt; {Read or forget}

Somehow already having read the emails makes every additional reading feel like
a superfluous chore - but at the same time, if it is not unread anymore I
forget about re-visiting the reading list. I really have no idea to resolve
this at the moment. But I feel that it could somehow be connected to your idea.
