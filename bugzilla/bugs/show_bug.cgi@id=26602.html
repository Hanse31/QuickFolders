<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I've got three suggestions:

1. In the &quot;Folder name&quot; box attached to the quickMove button, show the last
folder used so that the user can move a message (and any others sitting in the
quickMove button) to that folder by hitting Shift+M and then Enter. If the user
starts typing instead of hitting Enter, then the current folder name box
functionality applies (i.e. QuickFolders starts searching for folders with that
string in the name). 

2. Add a hotkey that moves messages to the Reading List.

3. Add a hotkey that moves messages to a default folder (this was an extremely
useful feature of the add-on Quicker Filer, which doesn't seem to be under
development any more and it's broken by Thunderbird 60).

Thanks for considering these suggestions.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Thanks for the suggestions - let's not have 3 different features in one bug,
because it makes it hard to track and implement / push it into the release
train.

let's keep this one for suggestion 1 - please open separate feature requests

prerelease versions for testing.

You are probably aware of the &quot;Recent Folders&quot; function which I am sure have
tried out. but rolling in some of that &quot;recent&quot; related stuff into quickmove /
quickjump  may be an idea anyway.

By default, when entering a foldername (or the start / part of it) then the
dropdown shows possible matches. With the &quot;unique match&quot; feature this could
potentially prefill the textbox with the last folder name and dropdown the
(unique) suggestion - so that hitting &quot;Enter&quot; would exeecute the operation on
the last folder. 

I would also have to auto-select the text so that typing would automatically
overwrite this suggestion. Is that roughly the way you imagined this?

Yes, that's what I had in mind. So it would be a two-key operation: (1) Shift+M
to put the message in the quickMove button, and (2) Enter to select the last
folder used. If the user starts typing at step 2, the typing would
automatically overwrite the suggestion.

Isn't that the way it works right now? Right now, if I select a message and hit
Shift+M and then cursor down, the dropdown list appears and the most
recently-used folder is selected. I guess my suggestion is simply to eliminate
one step from this process (and I agree that it would be wise to have the
feature as an option).

no. nothing shows unless you type at least one letter. the letters are not
sorted by date (most recent) but by relevance.

<span class="quote">&gt; I guess my suggestion is simply to eliminate
&gt; one step from this process (and I agree that it would be wise to have the
&gt; feature as an option).</span >

not quite - as you are not entering letters there is nothing to go from. (It's
not possible to sort by relevance without input) - as I said the list is
currently _not_ sorted by date. And a list displaying all folders wouldn't be
all that useful. In fact, if you only enter 2 letters I only show folders with
words that start with these 2 letters (I do not &quot;in-string&quot; matching) in order
to avoid too many irrelevant results.

again there is a separate function (recent folders tab) which is based on per
folder timestamps. Things like moving email (even from filters) can affect date
these timestamps. IIRC going to a folder also sets it.

<span class="quote">&gt; Would the following be easier to implement? 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. When the user selects a message and hits Shift+M, both the text box and the
&gt; drop-down list of recent folders appear, and the last-used folder is selected. </span >

&quot;and the last-used folder is selected.&quot;
how? You do not &quot;select&quot; a folder but you click on the menuitem representing
it; there is no &quot;selected state&quot; and no UI feedback for such a mechanism. This
happens immediately. therefore the sentence &quot;a folder is selected&quot; doesn't make
any sense. It's not possible.

OTTOH &quot;selection&quot; of a folder (to do quickMove) simply means a user action: the
input focus is on the menu so you can hit enter: you cannot type then and would
have to hit &quot;Cursor Up&quot; to get back into the text box. 

To &quot;select&quot; an item at the moment you hit &quot;Cursor Down&quot; (and then you cannot
type anymore). So this would be bad because it would slow you down - you
couldn't just keep typing anymore.

That's why I said (without wanting to rewrite the whole very hard to program
and test input logic I created) I would just copy the folder name into the
textbox and select thee text in the textbox (so that typing would replace it)


<span class="quote">&gt; 2a. If the user hits Enter, the message is moved to the last-used folder. </span >

Again - I want visual feedback - since there is no &quot;selected state&quot; possible as
of your suggestion above, the user will not know that the first item (of many
recent folders) is the target right now.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; 2b. If the user cursors down, another folder on the drop-down list is selected. </span >
If you want multiple recent folders then that would be possible with my first
suggestion (hit down on an empty textbox) but you would have to delete the
default text (last folder) first. Then cursor down (without having entered
anything) could bring up all recent folders in a dropdown.

So that would be 2 things
a) prefill with ONE recent folder
b) user hits [DEL] to empty the box, then [DOWN] to bring up all recent
folders. I know this is clunky, maybe I can think of a way to do this in a
single keystroke (not ESCAPE, as that's used to cancel quickjump)


<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; 2c. If the user starts typing, the box behaves as it does now by searching for
&gt; a match.</span >

on this one - 100% agreed :) I don't want to change or complicate current
behavior as it is important to get to any folder very quickly.

<span class="quote">&gt; Because this doesn't really change the current functionality, it may not be
&gt; necessary to make it optional (although there's no harm in having it optional,
&gt; apart from the work of coding it).</span >

Again, it all falls down on your (impossible) suggestion of &quot;selecting&quot; the
default folder from a dropdown which has no keyboard focus. You can't type once
the focus is on a menu - you will just get error sounds from the system - the
menu captures all input and reacts only to certain keystrokes.

I think I'm confusing things by using misleading words, because I don't
understand well enough the terminology that you've developed as part of
developing QuickFolders. I'll try to avoid using words like &quot;select&quot; and
&quot;focus&quot;.

&gt; &gt; drop-down list of recent folders appear, and the last-used folder is selected. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;and the last-used folder is selected.&quot;
&gt; how? You do not &quot;select&quot; a folder but you click on the menuitem representing
&gt; it; there is no &quot;selected state&quot; and no UI feedback for such a mechanism. This
&gt; happens immediately. therefore the sentence &quot;a folder is selected&quot; doesn't make
&gt; any sense. It's not possible.
&gt; 
&gt; OTTOH &quot;selection&quot; of a folder (to do quickMove) simply means a user action: the
&gt; input focus is on the menu so you can hit enter: you cannot type then and would
&gt; have to hit &quot;Cursor Up&quot; to get back into the text box. 
&gt; 
&gt; To &quot;select&quot; an item at the moment you hit &quot;Cursor Down&quot; (and then you cannot
&gt; type anymore). So this would be bad because it would slow you down - you
&gt; couldn't just keep typing anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; That's why I said (without wanting to rewrite the whole very hard to program
&gt; and test input logic I created) I would just copy the folder name into the
&gt; textbox and select thee text in the textbox (so that typing would replace it)
&gt; </span >

I'm sure I was using misleading language here. Let me try again. Right now,
when I select a message, hit Shift+M, and then hit the cursor down key, a red
&quot;Folder name&quot; box appears, and below it appears a list of folders, with the
most recently-used one at the top. That folder appears to have the focus such
that if I now hit Enter, the message is moved to that folder. What I'm
suggesting here is that the first step in the new process combines what happens
now when the user hits Shift+M and cursor down. Does that make any more sense?

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; 2a. If the user hits Enter, the message is moved to the last-used folder. 
&gt; 
&gt; Again - I want visual feedback - since there is no &quot;selected state&quot; possible as

&gt; recent folders) is the target right now.</span >

I quite agree that visual feedback is important. But I actually get it when the
drop-down list appears -- the most recent folder at the top is very clearly
selected.

<span class="quote">&gt;

&gt; default text (last folder) first. Then cursor down (without having entered
&gt; anything) could bring up all recent folders in a dropdown.
&gt; 
&gt; So that would be 2 things
&gt; a) prefill with ONE recent folder
&gt; b) user hits [DEL] to empty the box, then [DOWN] to bring up all recent
&gt; folders. I know this is clunky, maybe I can think of a way to do this in a
&gt; single keystroke (not ESCAPE, as that's used to cancel quickjump)</span >

I wasn't clear. What I meant by 2b was that, once the drop-down list of recent
folders is visible under the red text box, the user can cursor down the list to
pick another folder. That's all.


<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2c. If the user starts typing, the box behaves as it does now by searching for

&gt; 
&gt; on this one - 100% agreed :) I don't want to change or complicate current
&gt; behavior as it is important to get to any folder very quickly.</span >

Yep :)

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; Because this doesn't really change the current functionality, it may not be

&gt; the focus is on a menu - you will just get error sounds from the system - the
&gt; menu captures all input and reacts only to certain keystrokes.

I hope my explanation above clarifies what I meant by &quot;selecting&quot; from the

I think I'm confusing things by using misleading words, because I don't
understand well enough the terminology that you've developed as part of
developing QuickFolders. I'll try to avoid using words like &quot;select&quot; and

No, that doesn't happen for me. SHIFT+M and then cursor down brings up nothing.
I need to type some letters first. I think you are not describing what you are
doing :) 

It is very important not to leave out a single step otherwise you are
describing assumption but not reality. At the moment you always have at least
three key strokes. 
# SHIFT+M
# [one] letter
# CURSOR DOWN

If you only have ONE folder that starts with the letter, then you are lucky and
it will only find one result and you can hit ENTER straight away. Usually you
will have 2 or more folders and hence keep typing or use CURSOR DOWN to select
the correct one. Note: once you hit CURSOR DOWN you cannot type anymore.

<span class="quote">&gt; That folder appears to have the focus when you are on the MENU then it has focus. </span >
Yes, that's what you called &quot;selection&quot;. Bear in mind that this &quot;highlighted
state&quot; goes away as soon as you click into the text box again, so it's not a
&quot;Selected Status&quot; as such.

<span class="quote">&gt; The menu shows folders containing the letters you typed. it does NOT display recent folders.
&gt; such that if I now hit Enter, the message is moved to that folder. What I'm
&gt; suggesting here is that the first step in the new process combines what happens
&gt; now when the user hits Shift+M and cursor down. Does that make any more sense?</span >

no, because then you cannot type anymore. it would completely break quickMove /
quickJump :)
we need to be able to hit quickMove and just type as much as we like / need.
Also you can select chidl folders using the slash key:

FR/A
suggest all subfolders of parents that start with fr where the child folders
start with a. e.g. friends/alex, freunde/adam etc.

selection through typing is superfast and powerful. but you have to keep in
mind it has *nothing* to do with recent folders. If you are seeing recent
folders that's just because you use these folders a lot. quickMove is currently
100% reliant on *what* you enter. it ignores any &quot;time&quot; history :)

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2a. If the user hits Enter, the message is moved to the last-used folder.

no - the &quot;top folder&quot; is selected, (after hitting cursor down) and it is based
on your entry of some letter(s). unless your system works completely different
from mine :)


<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2b. If the user cursors down, another folder on the drop-down list is selected.

it just means that the complete recent folder dropdown is shown - but you would
still need the cursor down key for selecting the top item. At the moment the
recent folders are only shown if you use a different button / tab (the recent
folders tab). 

As regards showing the whole recent list automatically: Personally I wouldn't
like that as it would feel like &quot;visual clutter&quot; in most cases (when I want to
start typing a folder I do not use often). So the only thing that would feel
right to bring up automatically is a single folder (the most recent one). But
that is included in my suggestion already (which auto-fills the textbox with
the name and then will do exactly that). Also hitting [Enter] will jump or move
as long as there is only a single item in the dropdown, so that part is also
already coded. This would save me a lot of work.

Works for me, too :) The full folder name is a good idea -- it removes any
possibility of ambiguity. And I really like the way the name persists between
sessions. Thanks!

The text does seem erasable with ESC at the moment, and I think that's a good
idea. I'd keep it. We're all habituated now to using ESC to cancel things, so
I'm sure users will find themselves automatically using it here if they want to
cancel the name (which they can also do by starting to type in the box). 

So far, this seems great to me. Thanks again!

Ok - I made this a premium feature. Also added an option (on the QF Pro tab) to
disable the autofill.

ESC doesn't actually delete the (stored) entry it only hides the box, which was
already built in behavior. The question is if there should be a key to reset /
delete the folder name for good.

Oh -- sorry, I misunderstood. I guess there might be occasions on which a user
might want to do this, so what about using the backspace and delete keys? That

I thought about that but then you couldn't &quot;look up&quot; other folders while still
having the name stored for the &quot;real jump&quot; later (as I described). I don't
think it's a huge problem anyway.

&gt; I thought about that but then you couldn't &quot;look up&quot; other folders while still
&gt; having the name stored for the &quot;real jump&quot; later (as I described). I don't
&gt; think it's a huge problem anyway.
&gt; </span >

I see what you mean. Yes, I agree, it isn't a huge problem. I certainly
wouldn't change the action of the ESC key -- that works very well as it is now.
And another key or key combination might be a bit difficult to remember given
that the user isn't likely to want to reset/delete the folder very often. 

So far, the change is proving very useful.

edge case?

here is an example where it doesn't work so well:

If I use the entry 

qu/support

to move mails to the &quot;Quickfolders\support&quot; folder, the repeat action will only
remember the folder name (support) and not the parent. I wonder if we should
remember the full parent name in this case (it would make the result unique and
guarantee less work in scrolling through lots of results if we have a common
folder name used in a lot of instances). 

Note: I could try and only have this behavior when the search format

parentFolder/childFolder was used.

Added the behavior of memorizing the parent folder name if it was used as part
of the entered search.

if you enter qu/test and the subsequently jump to Quickfolders/Test, then the
string Quickfolders/Test is stored. This will better honor the previous effort
to distinguish a subfolder name that may not be unique.

Example - you might have a folder structure like this:

customer1/orders
customer1/payments
customer1/invoices
customer2/orders
customer2/payments
customer2/invoices
customer3/orders
customer3/payments
customer3/invoices

just storing the string &quot;invoices&quot; after entering &quot;customer1/inv&quot;  to get to a
unique folder would bring up 3 results. The use of the &quot;/&quot; character (as 2nd or
higher-numbered letter) will also remember the full parent name. This will
ensure much simpler re-use during autofill (ideally again just 1 result and
[ENTER] for going there; no selection from a submenu necessary)

I noticed if I use &quot;Drag-and-drop&quot; for moving emails the autofill doesn't focus
on the textbox like it does when using the keyboard shortcut (SHIFT+M).

This version fixes the problem so that we can also use the [Enter] key in this
case.

Hadn't noticed that, because I don't do much dragging and dropping. The new
