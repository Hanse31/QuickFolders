Bookmark mail folders in Thunderbird.

This extension adds an extra toolbar to Thunderbird. When you drag a mail folder to it, you get a shortcut to that mail folder (which you can rename). You can also drag messages to this shortcut to move/copy them to the folder, and access the bookmarked folders through keyboard shortcuts.

This is handy when you have a large tree of folders for clients or projects, but use only a few of them at the same time.
